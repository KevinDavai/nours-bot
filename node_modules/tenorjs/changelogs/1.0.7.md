**IMPORTANT:** This version is merely a superficial one, you can't publish identical versions to NPM and as such, I was forced to push it to v1.0.7.

### Bugs fixed:
1. **Error: Cannot find module '../../tenor_config.json'**

After v1.0.6 came out, I was alerted that apps were crashing on their first run due to an issue related to TenorJS being unable to locate the configuration file. This issue stemmed from the fact that I hardcoded `../../` into the section of the code responsible for reading and creating the configration file instead of using something like `Path.join` to reference the actual working directory.

I did not notice this at first because while working on and testing v1.0.6, I was using the actual library directory as opposed to testing it from a user's POV, which would have alerted me to this severe issue, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and I promise to be more attentive next time around.

The current major release is v1.0.6 so please visit the [v1.0.6 change-log](https://github.com/Jinzulen/TenorJS/tree/master/changelogs/1.0.6.md).
